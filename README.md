## Setup

From releases, download `install.php` and open it in web browser. Latest version will be downloaded, setup page will be opened. You will need an empty database.

## Appveyor

Nightly tag builds can be grabbed at [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/neptuo/is4wfw).

## Docker

Prebuilt docker images are in our ghcr.io repository [neptuo/is4wfw](https://ghcr.io/neptuo/is4wfw).
We are producing two types of images, one is production ready and the second one (with `-dev` suffix) has xdebug installed and configured, so it is intended for development purposes.
